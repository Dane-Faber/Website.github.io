            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycling">Motorcycling</a> refers to the activity of riding a motorcycle, which is a <strong>two-wheeled</strong> motorized vehicle. It involves balancing the bike while operating its controls, which typically include a throttle, brakes, and gears. Motorcycling can be a mode of transportation, a recreational activity, or a competitive sport.
